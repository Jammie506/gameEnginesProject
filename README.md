Game Engines Project for Semester 1

Project of Jamie Mccarthy | C17405366 | DT508 | 3rd Year

In this project i will be aiming to create an entity that will travel around a set point or object 
that can be placed in the world, so as to make it easy for the project to be used as a downloadable
assest, similar to those in the Unity Asset Store. The creature itsef I aim to have generated
somewhat randomly within parameters that will be set by the user using the Unity Editor, as such it
will need to be user friendly.

My main inspiration for this idea is some of the creatures in Infinite Forms, however I would like to
create something that is not too similar to them, and not too disimilar either, in fitting with the
brief

I have yet to source many tutorials for this project work, instead working based on my exosting unity 
experience. Any tutorials I use will be pasted below.
